#### **Reference**

* Locate the Stardew Valley file to automatically apply the mode according to the name of the mode file.
  * If it is a file name that can not be found automatically, you can assign it to the xnb file name in the game by pressing the 'Apply xnb Rename File' button. 

* Only the language with the same name is automatically applied to other files.
